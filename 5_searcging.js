// indexOf/lastIndexOf and includes
// The methods arr.indexOf, arr.lastIndexOf and arr.includes have the same syntax and do essentially the 
// same as their string counterparts, but operate on items instead of characters:

// arr.indexOf(item, from) – looks for item starting from index from, and returns the index where it was 
// found, otherwise -1.
// arr.lastIndexOf(item, from) – same, but looks for from right to left.
// arr.includes(item, from) – looks for item starting from index from, returns true if found.
